# 👋 Hi there.

## My internet handle is luojiahai.

I based my internet handle on my Chinese name, 罗嘉海 (luó jiā hǎi). I was born and raised in Guangzhou, China. Then, I moved to Australia. I speak Mandarin and Cantonese Chinese natively.

I am a software development engineer currently based in Melbourne, Australia. I graduated from the University of Melbourne with an advanced degree in computer science. I am currently working at REA Group, which owns realestate.com.au, Australia's leading property website.

Drawing from my industry experience, I excel in full-stack software development and site reliability engineering. Outside of work, I do some side projects on artificial intelligence and machine learning.
