I am a pragmatic software development engineer dedicated to crafting innovative solutions and solving complex problems
with principled thinking and engineering leadership. I excel in full-stack software development, leveraging cloud
computing and site reliability engineering. I am committed to exploring the vast realm of artificial intelligence and
practising state-of-the-art machine learning.

I was born and raised in guangzhou, china. Then, I migrated to australia with my family. I completed my undergraduate
and graduate degrees in computer science at the university of melbourne, where I conducted academic research on
explainable artificial intelligence.

I find joy in the culinary world, indulging in cooking, experimenting with recipes, savouring diverse cuisines, and
discovering eateries. I immensely enjoy yum-cha, barbecue, fried chicken, and mcdonald's. My favourite eats are pringles
sour cream and onion flavour potato crisps, proper onion with green chives flavour potato crisps, kinder happy hippo
cocoa wafer, and coca-cola zero sugar soft drink.
