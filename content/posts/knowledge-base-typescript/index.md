TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

## The TypeScript compiler

Install the TypeScript Compiler `tsc` globally.
```shell
npm install -g typescript
```

Now let‚Äôs move to an empty folder and try writing our first TypeScript program: `hello.ts`:
```
// Greets the world.
console.log("Hello world!");
```

Notice there are no frills here; this ‚Äúhello world‚Äù program looks identical to what you‚Äôd write for a ‚Äúhello world‚Äù program in JavaScript. And now let‚Äôs type-check it by running the command `tsc` which was installed for us by the `typescript` package.
```
tsc hello.ts
```

In our current directory, we see a `hello.js` file next to `hello.ts`. That‚Äôs the output from our `hello.ts` file after `tsc` compiles or transforms it into a plain JavaScript file.

## Configure TypeScript environment

Make a directory. In the directory root, run:
```
tsc --init
```

Now, the TypeScript configuration file `tsconfig.json` is generated in the directory root.
```
{
	"compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es6",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "strict": true,
  }
}
```
