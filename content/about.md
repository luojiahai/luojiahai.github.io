👋 Hi there, I am luojiahai (luo-jia-hai).

I am from Guangzhou, China 🇨🇳, in which I was born and raised. I am currently based in Melbourne, Australia.

I was born in the Chinese year of Pig 🐷. My personality is Architect
([INTJ-A](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality/)). My Zodiac sign is Cancer ♋, Libra ascendant.

I completed studies in Computer Science at the University of Melbourne. I am working professionally in the computer
industry. Checkout the [Curriculum Vitae](/cv) for my professional profile.

I find joy in the culinary world, indulging in cooking, experimenting with recipes, savouring diverse cuisines,
and discovering eateries. I immensely enjoy yum-cha, barbecue, and fried chicken.

articles, notes, and food recipes.
