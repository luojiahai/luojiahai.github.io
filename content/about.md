## Me

Hi there, I am luojiahai (luo-jia-hai). I am from Guangzhou, China ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³. I am currently based in Melbourne, Australia. My
personality is Architect [INTJ-A](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality/).

I completed studies in Computer Science at the University of Melbourne. I am working professionally in the computer
industry. My CV is in this [page](/cv).

I find joy in the culinary world, indulging in cooking, experimenting with recipes, savouring diverse cuisines, and
discovering eateries. I immensely enjoy yum-cha, barbecue, and fried chicken.

## The site

This site is just for fun. It is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for free, powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
I post technical articles, notes, and food recipes.
