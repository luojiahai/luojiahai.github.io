## About

I am a pragmatic software development engineer dedicated to crafting innovative solutions and solving complex problems
with principled thinking and engineering leadership. I excel in full-stack software development, leveraging cloud
computing and site reliability engineering. I practise the vast realm of artificial intelligence and state-of-the-art
machine learning.

I was born and raised in guangzhou, china. Then, I migrated to australia with my family. I completed my undergraduate
and graduate degrees in computer science at the university of melbourne, where I conducted academic research on
explainable artificial intelligence.

Outside of work, I find joy in the culinary world, indulging in cooking, experimenting with recipes, savouring diverse
cuisines, and discovering eateries. I immensely enjoy yum-cha, barbecue, fried chicken, and mcdonald's.

My favourite edibles are pringles sour cream and onion flavour potato crisps, proper onion with green chives flavour
potato crisps, kinder happy hippo cocoa wafer, and coca-cola zero sugar soft drink.
