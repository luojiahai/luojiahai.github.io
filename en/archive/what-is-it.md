# what is it?

this is my personal site, statically generated using [vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/) and hosted on [github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). it is available in both english and simplified chinese, with support for light and dark themes.

the favicon of this site is a 💾 floppy disk, the first portable storage device i ever used, the 3½‑inch kind. back then, most computers had a built‑in floppy disk drive; you could insert the disk to read or write data.

my handle `luojiahai` is derived from the [pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pinyin) of my name, 罗嘉海 (luó jiā hǎi). 罗 is my family name, 嘉 means excellent or auspicious, and 海 means sea or ocean. i use it consistently across usernames, emails, and social networks, essentially everywhere on the internet.
