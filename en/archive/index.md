this is my personal site, statically generated using [vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/) and hosted on [github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). it is available in both english and simplified chinese, with support for light and dark themes.

the favicon of this site is a 💾 floppy disk, the first portable storage device i ever used, the 3½‑inch kind. back then, most computers had a built‑in floppy disk drive.

my handle `luojiahai` is taken from the [pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pinyin) of my name, 罗嘉海 (luó, jiāhǎi), its [jyutping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jyutping) (cantonese romanization) is **law ka hoi**. 罗 is my family name and has no meaning in this context. 嘉海 is my given name, 嘉 means excellent or auspicious, and 海 means sea or ocean. i use it consistently across usernames, emails, and social networks, essentially everywhere on the internet.

in the english-speaking world, i use my anglicized name, geoffrey, pronounced the same as jeffrey, not "jee-oh" at the start.
