this is my personal site, statically generated using [vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/) and hosted on [github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). it is available in both english and simplified chinese, with support for light and dark themes.

my handle luojiahai is taken from the [pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pinyin) of my name, 罗嘉海 (luó jiā hǎi). i use the handle consistently across usernames, emails, and social networks, essentially everywhere on the internet. the cantonese romanization of my name is law ka hoi. in real life, in english-speaking places, i also use my anglicized name, geoffrey, pronounced the same as jeffrey.

i was born in guangzhou, the capital city of guangdong province in china. i'm a native speaker of both mandarin and cantonese, though my proficiency in programming languages is probably better. i'm currently based in melbourne, australia, working in tech.
