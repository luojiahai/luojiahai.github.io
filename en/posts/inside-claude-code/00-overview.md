# Inside Claude Code: Overview

Claude Code is built on roughly 512,000 lines of code. The client-side source covers the agent loop engine, 40+ built-in tools, system prompt assembly logic, a three-tier memory system, context compression, and a permission layer, along with a handful of unreleased features.

The whole thing runs on React Ink, which lets you write terminal UIs with React. Think "webdev but in the terminal." That's why the Claude Code CLI feels so much smoother than most traditional tools.

At a high level, the architecture breaks down into 6 layers:

1. **CLI and UI layer**: everything you see in the terminal
2. **Agent loop engine**: the brain, where all decisions originate
3. **Tool system**: 40+ built-in tools plus MCP extensions
4. **Memory system**: solving the "AI forgets everything" problem
5. **Context compression**: keeping token costs under control
6. **Permission and security layer**: at the bottom, holding everything accountable

## The Agent Loop

Modern AI coding tools aren't simple Q&A. They're autonomous agents that plan and execute across multiple steps. You might expect that kind of capability to require some sophisticated orchestration framework under the hood.

Open `query.ts`, and what you find is a `while(true)` loop.

```typescript
// query.ts
while (true) {
  // 1. Compress context (prevent token explosion)
  // 2. Call the model, stream response
  // 3. Parse tool calls from the response
  // 4. Execute tools, collect results
  // 5. Append results to conversation history
  // 6. If no new tool calls, exit; otherwise continue
}
```

Each iteration: compress context if needed, call the model, check if the response contains tool calls. If it does, execute those tools, append the results, loop again. When there are no more tool calls, the task is done.

This is the ReAct pattern (Reasoning + Acting), a tight "think → act → observe → think again" loop. Simple in concept, powerful in practice.

## Tool Design

The 40+ built-in tools are registered in `tools.ts`. Tool registration isn't just a feature concern; it has direct cost implications. The list must stay in sync with A/B test configuration, otherwise the globally cached system prompt breaks.

When a user has many MCP plugins connected, Claude Code doesn't dump every tool's full schema into the API tools parameter. It gives the model a compact list of tool names with one-line descriptions, lets the model pick what it needs, then loads the full definitions on demand. Significant token savings.

Each tool is built with fail-closed defaults. `isConcurrencySafe` and `isReadOnly` both default to `false`. If a tool author forgets to declare "this is read-only," the system treats it as a write operation and blocks concurrent execution. No badge, no entry.

```typescript
// Tool.ts
const TOOL_DEFAULTS = {
  isEnabled: () => true,
  isConcurrencySafe: () => false, // assume not safe
  isReadOnly: () => false, // assume writes
  isDestructive: () => false,
  toAutoClassifierInput: () => "", // skip classifier — security-relevant tools must override
};
```

## Read/Write Concurrency Separation

When the model wants to read 3 files and edit 1 simultaneously, `toolOrchestration.ts` separates them. Consecutive concurrency-safe tools (`isConcurrencySafe: true`) run in parallel; the moment a non-concurrency-safe operation appears, it waits for all preceding operations to finish.

Note that `isConcurrencySafe` and `isReadOnly` are two independent properties. A tool can be concurrency-safe without being read-only, and vice versa. Parallelism is controlled by `isConcurrencySafe` alone.

The fail-closed pattern shows up again here. If the concurrency safety check itself throws an exception, that's treated as unsafe. If input parsing fails, that's also unsafe. The concurrency cap defaults to 10, configurable via env var.

## System Prompt Cache Splitting

Anthropic's API caches prompt prefixes. If the start of your system prompt stays constant across requests, it gets reused, skipping reprocessing and cutting costs.

Claude Code splits the system prompt at a `DYNAMIC_BOUNDARY` marker. Everything above is static: role definition, behavior rules, tool usage instructions. Everything below is dynamic: your current timestamp, git repo state, CLAUDE.md config. Different per user, loaded independently.

```typescript
// constants/prompts.ts
sections = [
  // Static (shared cache across all users)
  getSimpleIntroSection(),
  getUsingYourToolsSection(enabledTools),
  // ...
  SYSTEM_PROMPT_DYNAMIC_BOUNDARY, // === do not move or remove ===
  // Dynamic (per-user, not cached)
  ...resolvedDynamicSections, // current time, git state, CLAUDE.md, MCP tools, etc.
];
```

Accidentally mixing dynamic content into the static section invalidates the cache for everyone. The codebase has cross-file warnings to keep the boundary coordinated. If you're building AI apps at any real call volume, this pattern makes a meaningful dent in API costs.

## Retrieval Strategy: Grep Over RAG

The model has no native memory of your codebase. The standard approach is RAG: embed your project into a vector database, retrieve semantically similar chunks at query time, feed them to the model.

Claude Code doesn't use RAG. For both memory file search and historical conversation search, it uses plain `grep`.

```typescript
// memdir/memdir.ts
const memSearch = `grep -rn "<search term>" ${autoMemDir} --include="*.md"`;
const transcriptSearch = `grep -rn "<search term>" ${projectDir}/ --include="*.jsonl"`;
```

Claude Code's creator Boris Cherny has said they tried RAG, but letting the AI decide what to search for and how to search produces far better results. An agent with direct access to the full document library and the freedom to dig beats a pre-packaged information bundle, especially as models get stronger. And `grep` has no index expiry, no vector database to maintain, and an order of magnitude less engineering complexity.

## Three-Tier Memory Architecture

This is the most elegant design in the codebase. Anyone who's used an AI coding tool long enough has hit the wall: deep into a session, the AI starts contradicting itself, losing the thread. Claude Code addresses this with a tiered memory system.

**Tier 1: MEMORY.md (hot data)** — Loaded into context every conversation. Hard capped at 200 lines and 25KB. It stores pointers, not content. If truncation kicks in, the model is explicitly told the index is incomplete, so it doesn't silently work with partial information.

```typescript
// memdir/memdir.ts
export const MAX_ENTRYPOINT_LINES = 200;
export const MAX_ENTRYPOINT_BYTES = 25_000;
```

**Tier 2: Topic files (warm data)** — Coding preferences, architectural decisions, known pitfalls. At the start of each conversation, Sonnet selects up to 5 files relevant to the current query. If a tool is actively being used, its documentation is skipped (you clearly know how to use it), but its known issues are always loaded.

```typescript
// memdir/findRelevantMemories.ts
const SELECT_MEMORIES_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are selecting memories that will be
useful to Claude Code as it processes a user's query.
Return a list of filenames for the memories that will clearly be useful (up to 5).
- DO NOT select usage reference or API docs for tools currently in use.
- DO still select memories containing warnings, gotchas, or known issues — active
  use is exactly when those matter.`;
```

Also worth noting: Claude Code's memory never stores code. Code changes; memory doesn't auto-update. Memory tracks preferences and judgments; code facts are always read from source in real time.

**Tier 3: Conversation history (cold data)** — Older conversations stored as `.jsonl` files, searched by `grep` when needed.

Hot data stays resident. Warm data is selected by Sonnet at conversation start based on relevance to the query. Cold data is searched. Clean.

## Five-Level Context Compression

Context windows have limits. Long sessions with lots of tool call results will burn through tokens fast. Claude Code handles this with five compression strategies, applied lightest-to-heaviest:

1. **Snip**: strip old tool call results down to structure only
2. **Microcompact**: offload large tool execution results to a cache
3. **Context Collapse**: summarize intermediate conversation, keeping only key information
4. **Autocompact**: full summary compression when context usage crosses a threshold
5. **Reactive Compact**: emergency fallback, triggered when the API returns a 413 error

There's also a circuit breaker. On March 10, 2026, they measured 1,279 sessions with 50+ consecutive compression failures, the worst hitting 3,272 retries in a single session. That translated to 250,000 wasted API calls per day globally. The fix: stop after 3 consecutive failures.

## Security Layer

Claude Code has a `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag (YOLO mode) that bypasses all permission checks entirely — including the AI classifier. The classifier only runs in `--permission-mode auto`, a separate mode where a shadow AI evaluates every action the model wants to take.

```typescript
// utils/permissions/yoloClassifier.ts — runs in auto mode, not bypass mode
export async function classifyYoloAction(
  toolName: string,
  toolInput: Record<string, unknown>,
): Promise<"allow" | "soft_deny" | "hard_deny">;
// allow: safe, proceed
// soft_deny: risky, downgrade to manual confirmation
// hard_deny: blocked, no negotiation
```

That's just one checkpoint. Before a tool call executes, it passes through four permission and validation stages: Zod schema validation, custom input validation, pre-tool hooks, and permission resolution (which for Bash runs through the 23 bash security rules). The most restrictive result wins.

```typescript
// tools/BashTool/bashSecurity.ts
const BASH_SECURITY_CHECK_IDS = {
  INCOMPLETE_COMMANDS: 1, // Commands starting with tab or dash
  JQ_SYSTEM_FUNCTION: 2, // jq system() function calls
  SHELL_METACHARACTERS: 5, // Dangerous shell metacharacters
  IFS_INJECTION: 11, // IFS variable injection
  UNICODE_WHITESPACE: 18, // Unicode whitespace (parser differential)
  ZSH_DANGEROUS_COMMANDS: 20, // zmodload and similar Zsh bypasses
  // ... 23 total
};
```

## Anti-Distillation and Undercover Mode

Two defensive mechanisms to prevent capability theft and internal information leakage.

**Anti-distillation.** A competitor could record Claude Code's API traffic and use those input-output pairs to distill a smaller model with similar behavior. Anthropic's response: inject fake tool definitions into the API request. Not encryption or rate limiting. It actively feeds bad training data into any captured traffic, so any model trained on those recordings degrades over time. Only activates in the official first-party CLI.

**Undercover mode.** When Anthropic employees use Claude Code to contribute to open-source projects, this mode activates automatically, stripping all attribution to avoid leaking internal model codenames or project names. There is no force-off. It defaults to active for Anthropic employees and only turns off when the repo is confirmed internal.

```typescript
// utils/undercover.ts
export function isUndercover(): boolean {
  if (process.env.USER_TYPE === "ant") {
    if (isEnvTruthy(process.env.CLAUDE_CODE_UNDERCOVER)) return true;
    // Auto: active unless we've confirmed we're in an internal repo.
    return getRepoClassCached() !== "internal";
  }
  return false;
}
```

## The Takeaway

Looking at the source end-to-end, there's no secret sauce. No novel algorithms. Everything in Claude Code is built on concepts working engineers have encountered before: concurrency control, read/write separation, layered caching, circuit breakers, feature flags.

What's impressive is how well those fundamentals are applied to the specific constraints of an AI agent with full access to your codebase. Every design decision has a reason. Every default is conservative. Every edge case is handled explicitly.

The fundamentals matter. They always did.
