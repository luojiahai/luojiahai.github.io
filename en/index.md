hi there, i'm **luojiahai**, a pragmatic engineer in programming. i was born in guangzhou, the capital of guangdong province in china. i natively speak mandarin and cantonese. i'm currently based in melbourne, australia, working hard for a living.

the handle **luojiahai** is taken from the [pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pinyin) of my name, **罗嘉海** (**luó jiā hǎi**). i use this handle essentially everywhere on the internet. the cantonese romanization of my name is **law ka hoi**. in real life, in english-speaking places, i use my anglicized name, **geoffrey**.
