# What is it?

It is my personal site, statically generated using [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).

My handle `luojiahai` is derived from the Pinyin of my name, 罗嘉海 (luó jiā hǎi). I use it consistently across usernames, emails, and social networks, everywhere on the Internet.
