# what is it?

it is my personal site, statically generated using [vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/) and hosted on [github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).

my handle `luojiahai` is derived from the pinyin of my name, 罗嘉海 (luó jiā hǎi). i use it consistently across usernames, emails, and social networks, everywhere on the internet.
