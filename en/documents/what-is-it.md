# What is it?

It is my personal site, statically generated using [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/). It includes my professional profile and résumé, both available from the homepage. This site does not host a blog or portfolio.

## Who am I?

I am Geoffrey (anglicized). My handle is luojiahai, which is derived from the Pinyin of my name, 罗嘉海 (luó jiā hǎi), and I use it consistently across usernames, emails, and social networks, essentially everywhere on the Internet.

My proclaimed title is Non‑Senior Earth Resident, as I still have much to learn about how to be a good one, living on Earth and getting along with my fellow Earth residents.

## What I do?

I am currently a Senior Software Engineer at [REA Group](https://www.rea-group.com/) (ASX:REA), the company that operates [realestate.com.au](https://www.realestate.com.au/), one of Australia's leading property websites. I highly recommend working here for its great people‑driven culture and the meaningful impact its products have on millions of Australians.

Previously, I was a Software Development Engineer at [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/), one of the major US tech companies. I appreciated the scale, technical challenges, and talented colleagues, but I found that the culture and management style didn’t align well with how I work best.
